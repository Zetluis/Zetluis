### Hi there, I'm Luis ðŸ‘‹ :man_technologist:

<!--
**Zetluis/Zetluis** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a 23 yeard old Economics Student at the Central University of Venezuela (known in Spanish as UCV). I've wanted to learn how to code for a while and in 2020 I dediced to learn how to code in R. I'm currently about 7 months into my journey and it has been a lot of fun and a lot of frustration as well (especially when trying to learn regular expressions). Now I'm taking my time learning statistics from scratch and also contributing weekly to the #Tidytuesday challenge from the `R4DS Online Learning Community`. You can find my contributions in my [R_tidytuesday](https://github.com/Zetluis/R_Tidytuesday) repository.
